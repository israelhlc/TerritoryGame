TerritoryGame is a framework for Artificial Intelligence Research through a turn-based strategy game.

This is the final project I presented for my master's degree in Computer Science. The code was written in C#, designed for a XNA game. Unfortunately, there is no UI for the game, so all actions are logged on the console.

If you need any other information, feel free contact me.
